However, no standardized method for measuring the state of health at the\nvehicle level has been established, leaving both academia and industry without\na clear consensus. Ultimately, standardization is crucial to increase transparency\nand build confidence in the long-term reliability of electric vehicles\u2019 battery packs.\nIn this article, we propose a standard measurement procedure for assessing the\ncapacity- and energy-based state of health, leveraging onboard charging to enable\nreproducibility and scalability. Additionally, we demonstrate how differential\nvoltage analysis can provide deeper insights into battery aging at the vehicle level.\nKeywords: Battery aging, Battery pack diagnostics, Differential voltage analysis,\nElectric vehicle, Lithium-ion battery, State of health\n1arXiv:2508.15517v1  [eess.SY]  21 Aug 2025\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nIntroduction\nElectric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as the breakthrough solution to decarbonize and\nelectrify the transportation sector, capable of significantly reducing greenhouse gas\nemissions [1]. Enablers for the acceptance of electric mobility and exponential growth\nin EV sales are advancements and innovations in their battery packs, which are cur-\nrently mostly assembled with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [2]. These battery packs\nmust satisfy the customer\u2019s required achievable range and power capabilities, embody-\ning central properties for purchasing an EV [3]. However, these capabilities degrade\nthroughout the EV\u2019s usage life due to a complex and coupled interplay of reversible\nand irreversible aging mechanisms [4]. Typically, battery aging is generally expressed\nby means of the state of health (SOH) that aggregates degradation in the remaining\ncapacity or energy, expressed as a scalar value in reference to pristine conditions [5].\nOn the vehicle level, this offers a simple approach directly correlating to the remain-\ning achievable range of an EV [6]. However, to our knowledge, neither industry nor\nacademia has a consensus on a vehicle-level SOH definition or a standard procedure for\nits measurement, lacking standardization and a common understanding of how aging\nshall be characterized for EVs. Furthermore, only considering the overall capacity- or\nenergy loss superficially reflects battery aging, i.e., EVs with the same SOH might\nhave degraded through different aging mechanisms [7].\nHence, with increasing efforts to establish a holistic and circular battery ecosys-\ntem, it is vital to precisely express battery degradation to achieve an accurate SOH\nrepresentation [8]. This allows stakeholders along the entire EV value chain to operate\nthe battery within ideal parameters and make informed decisions regarding mainte-\nnance, use in second-life applications, or recycling, thus maximizing resource efficiency\nand reducing costs [9]. Furthermore, an accurate depiction in the SOH provides trans-\nparency regarding insurance premiums or liability decisions in warranty claims [10].\nIt also lays the foundation for assessing the residual value of secondhand vehicles [11].\nIn summary, a transparent, reproducible standard measurement is necessary for a\nvehicle-level SOH definition that covers the overall capacity/energy loss and enables\ndeeper insights into the degradation condition of the battery pack.\nThis article emphasizes the importance of vehicle-level SOH standardization and\nproposes a transparent and reproducible standard measurement for capacity- and\nenergy-based metrics derived from electrochemical properties of LIBs and designed\nfor in-vehicle utilization. The overall aim is to close the gap between the necessity\nof a vehicle-level SOH definition and the uncertainty of its determination, which is\nnecessary for accepting battery electric vehicles as a suitable long-term alternative to\nconventional vehicles.\n2\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nResults\nRegulation, standardization, and the EU battery passport\nThe importance of SOH standardization has reached the political arena as numerous\npolitical institutions have imposed and regularly expanded regulations to guarantee\nsustainability, safety, and quality standards for products containing batteries, with\nrecent extensions to EVs [12]. Most notable is European Union (EU) Regulation\n2023/1542, making a digital battery passport mandatory for new EVs entering service\nby 2027 [13]. The overall goal is to define technical standards, among which the SOH\nis explicitly named as an essential performance metric of batteries, aiming at a more\nsustainable battery value chain. However, its articles concerning the SOH lack techni-\ncal detail and merely state that it must be given as an energy-based value for electric\nvehicles, named the state of certified energy (SOCE). Additionally, a rated capacity\nmust be given in the vehicle registration documents, which is not explicitly appointed\nas a reference for the SOH but can serve as one. Ultimately, the regulation misses a\ndefinition of standard measurement and reference for obtaining the SOH or SOCE,\nwhich substantially impacts the values obtained. This has also been criticized by the\nbattery pass consortium [14], a publicly funded initiative uniting strategic partners in\nthe field of EVs, which demands regulatory clarity.\nSolely United Nations (UN) Global Technical Regulation No. 22 [15], incorporated\ninto the EURO 7 [16] to regulate emissions and battery durability of motor vehicles,\naddresses the necessity and challenges for vehicle-level health metrics. The regulation\nadvocates for \u201din-use verification\u201d via the tailored EV driving cycle Worldwide harmo-\nnized Light Duty Test Cycle (WLTC) through which the SOCE and state of certified\nrange (SOCR) are determined, but not the remaining capacity, which is, however,\nnecessary for the previously mentioned EU regulation.\nInternational standards are equally unsuited, e.g., ISO 12405-4 [17] vaguely pro-\nposes standard (dis)charging cycles for battery packs of EVs relying on the battery\n\u201dsupplier\u2019s recommendations,\u201d which are not publicly available.\nThe goal of SOH standardization for EVs is definite from a political point of view.\nHowever, the labyrinth of regulation and standardization lacks a clear definition of\nwhat constitutes a vehicle level SOH, to which reference it is based, and how it shall\nbe measured.\nViable approaches for a vehicle-level battery state of health\nstandard measurement\nThe general methodologies for defining a standard measurement for an EV\u2019s SOH are\nreviewed in this section and can be classified into model-based and measurement-based\napproaches.\nModel-based approaches estimate the SOH, e.g., through electrochemical or equiv-\nalent circuit models, but inherit model inaccuracies and are either unsuitable for online\napplication or imprecise [18]. The SOH read directly from the vehicle\u2019s battery man-\nagement system (BMS) is estimated by such models [5]. However, this SOH is supplied\n3\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nby the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), which can have an incentive to manip-\nulation so that it does not necessarily coincide with actual battery aging. Therefore,\nexclusive reliance on model-based approaches is not recommended.\nMeasurement-based approaches actively stress the EV\u2019s battery pack either by\ndischarging or charging, which is further discussed in terms of their suitability for\nstandard measurement and data processing, with an overview in Figure 1.\nFig. 1 : Qualitative evaluation of viable SOH standard measurements at the vehi-\ncle level, focusing on scalability for in-vehicle utilization and reproducibility of the\nmeasurement procedure. A standard measurement method based on unidirectional\ncharging satisfies both criteria. The data obtained from EV measurements can either\nbe continuous or dynamic. The former is suited for deeper battery degradation anal-\nysis, and the latter for real-world consumption and range analysis.\nDischarging the battery pack during driving cycles mimics an EV\u2019s actual operation\nand use case, which can be performed on test benches (e.g., chassis dynamometer) or\non the road. The former ensures reproducibility but is cumbersome, time-consuming,\nand expensive, impairing scalability. Real-world driving profiles on the road are an\napplication advantage but not reproducible due to fluctuating external influences.\nFurthermore, due to the dynamic loads, insights into the batteries\u2019 behavior and degra-\ndation states are difficult to obtain. Therefore, driving profiles, neither on a test bench\nnor on (public) roads, are suitable as a standard measurement for the SOH but are\nimportant for actual real-world energy consumption and range estimations of EVs.\nContinuous discharging of the battery by auxiliary units is possible for a repro-\nducible measurement but is time-consuming and less applicable in operation as energy\nis wasted through heat dissipation, and recharging is necessary for the following use.\n4\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nA bidirectional charging standard can provide an opportunity for a controlled dis-\ncharging procedure and automated recharging without significant energy loss, but it\nhas yet to be widely adopted [19].\nA scalable and reproducible approach relies on onboard charging, as stressing the\nbattery pack takes place in a controlled manner defined by standardized protocols (e.g.,\nISO 15118 or IEC 61851). Hereby, thermodynamic changes in the voltage signal can\nbe captured for further degradation assessment, e.g., by differential voltage (DV) anal-\nysis, which can provide detailed information on where the overall capacity/energy\nloss occurs [20]. The measurement can conveniently be integrated into vehicle oper-\nation to monitor the SOH throughout the vehicle\u2019s lifetime, as EVs must regularly\nbe charged, and the availability of chargers has increased throughout the years, espe-\ncially wallboxes for homeowners [21]. Hereby, using alternating current (AC) or direct\ncurrent (DC) chargers is arbitrary when sampling data from the EV\u2019s BMS, as the\ncharging power is ultimately transformed into the battery pack\u2019s DC system. A ben-\nefit of DC charging is the capability of charger-side data acquisition due to necessary\nstandardized communication norms (e.g., ISO 15118), where the battery pack\u2019s volt-\nage and current values are periodically transmitted to the charger\u2019s backend. Given\nthese advantages, onboard charging is best suited for developing a SOH standard\nmeasurement for EV battery packs.\nA standard charging measurement proposal\nAny standard measurement must be unambiguously defined for transparency and\nreproducibility. For a standard charging measurement, shown in Figure 2a for a\nVolkswagen (VW) ID.3, this implies fixed conditions for the charging procedure,\nincluding the charging rate and cut-off constraints, the ambient temperature, and the\npreparation setup [22].\nThe maximum charging rate must meet a trade-off between the overall measure-\nment duration and the containment of overpotentials that stem from ohmic and kinetic\nresistances in the batteries [23]. The latter limits the transferable capacity/energy,\nwhich are, however, the quantities of interest [22]. Therefore, a measurement duration\nof at least t= 15 h is proposed to contain the influence of overpotentials. The mea-\nsurement time seems lengthy but yields the most accurate results, which is further\ndiscussed in Section 1. The maximum charging power can be determined for each EV\nby the E\u2212rate, which is the inverse of the charging time tnormalized by the battery\npack\u2019s net energy, as given in Equation 1.\nE\u2212rate=Pmax\nEN<1\nt\u21d2Pmax<1\nt\u00b7EN (1)\nWith typical battery pack energies up to 120 kW h [24], this results in a maximum\ncharging power of 8 kW, which is below typical wallbox powers in the EU of 11 kW\nenabling simple utilization. For charging, we propose a constant power (CP) protocol,\nas it is common for EV charging due to energy conservation with the grid.\nFurthermore, the minimum measuring window, i.e., the cut-off conditions, must be\ndefined either by a state of charge (SOC) window or voltage range. Fixing a voltage\n5\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n/uni000003ec/uni000003ed/uni000003ec/uni000003f4/uni000003ee/uni000003f3/uni000003ec/uni000003ef/uni000003f3/uni000003f4/uni000003f0/uni000003f4/uni000003f2/uni00000073/uni0000011e/uni0000015a/uni0000015d/uni00000110/uni0000016f/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni000001c0/uni0000017d/uni0000016f/uni0000019a/uni00000102/uni00000150/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni0000015d/uni00000176/uni00000003/uni00000073/uni00000059/uni00000110/uni00000102/uni0000016f/uni00000110/uni00000358/uni00000441/uni0000002f/uni0000011a/uni0000019a\n/uni0000001c/uni00000110/uni00000102/uni0000016f/uni00000110/uni00000358/uni00000441/uni00000068/uni0000002f/uni0000011a/uni0000019a\n/uni000001c0/uni0000011e/uni0000015a/uni0000015d/uni00000110/uni0000016f/uni0000011e/uni00000003\n/uni00000128/uni000001b5/uni0000016f/uni0000016f/uni00000003/uni00000110/uni0000011e/uni0000016f/uni0000016f/uni00000176/uni0000011e/uni00000150/uni00000102/uni0000019a/uni0000015d/uni000001c0/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni0000011e/uni0000016f/uni0000011e/uni00000110/uni0000019a/uni0000018c/uni0000017d/uni0000011a/uni0000011e\n/uni00000189/uni0000017d/uni00000190/uni0000015d/uni0000019a/uni0000015d/uni000001c0/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni0000011e/uni0000016f/uni0000011e/uni00000110/uni0000019a/uni0000018c/uni0000017d/uni0000011a/uni0000011e\n/uni000003ec /uni000003f1/uni000003ec /uni000003ed/uni000003ec/uni000003ec /uni000003ed/uni000003f1/uni000003ec\n/uni00000073/uni0000011e/uni0000015a/uni0000015d/uni00000110/uni0000016f/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni00000110/uni0000015a/uni00000102/uni0000018c/uni00000150/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni0000015d/uni00000176/uni00000003/uni00000004/uni0000015a/uni000003ec/uni000003ed/uni000003ec/uni000003f4/uni000003ee/uni000003ed/uni000003f2/uni00000059/uni00000045/uni00000355/uni00000189/uni00000102/uni00000110/uni0000016c /uni0000036e/uni0000011a/uni00000068/uni00000189/uni00000102/uni00000110/uni0000016c\n/uni0000011a/uni00000059/uni00000189/uni00000102/uni00000110/uni0000016c/uni0000036e/uni00000003/uni0000015d/uni00000176/uni00000003/uni00000073\n/uni000003ec/uni000003ed/uni00000358/uni000003f1/uni000003ee/uni00000358/uni000003f1/uni000003ef/uni00000358/uni000003f1/uni000003f0/uni00000358/uni000003f1\n/uni00000012/uni0000011e/uni0000016f/uni0000016f/uni00000003/uni000001c0/uni0000017d/uni0000016f/uni0000019a/uni00000102/uni00000150/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni0000015d/uni00000176/uni00000003/uni00000073/uni000003ec /uni000003ee/uni000003ec /uni000003f0/uni000003ec /uni000003f2/uni000003ec/uni00000073/uni0000011e/uni0000015a/uni0000015d/uni00000110/uni0000016f/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni0000011e/uni00000176/uni0000011e/uni0000018c/uni00000150/uni000001c7/uni00000003/uni0000015d/uni00000176/uni00000003/uni0000016c/uni00000074/uni0000015a\n/uni000003ec/uni000003ed/uni000003ee\n/uni00000059/uni00000045/uni00000355/uni00000110/uni0000011e/uni0000016f/uni0000016f /uni0000036e/uni0000011a/uni00000068/uni00000110/uni0000011e/uni0000016f/uni0000016f\n/uni0000011a/uni00000059/uni00000110/uni0000011e/uni0000016f/uni0000016f/uni0000036e/uni00000003/uni0000015d/uni00000176/uni00000003/uni00000073\n/uni00000059/uni00000045/uni0000001c/uni00000059/uni00000011\n/uni00000059/uni00000057/uni0000001c\n/uni000003f0/uni0000003e /uni000003ef/uni0000003e\n/uni000003ee/uni0000003e/uni00000190/uni0000019a/uni00000102/uni00000150/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni000003ee\n/uni0000002c/uni000003ed/uni00000044/uni0000002c/uni000003eeFig. 2 : Charging measurement of a VW ID.3 following the proposed standard mea-\nsurement. a) Full and half-cell laboratory measurements from a VW ID.3 pouch cell\nare aligned to the vehicle\u2019s voltage and capacity data, showing the transferability of\ncell-specific characteristics like the potential contribution of the positive and negative\nelectrodes during (de)lithiation. b) DV curves are calculated from the derivation of the\nvoltage signal and enable deeper analysis of the battery\u2019s electrochemical condition.\nChanges in the characteristic capacities QNE,QPE, and QBthroughout aging enable\nthe calculation of degradation modes to determine loss of active material (LAM) at\nthe negative electrode (NE), positive electrode (PE), and loss of lithium inventory\n(LLI) [55]. DV analysis can also be utilized on the vehicle level, but limitations are to\nbe considered, e.g., cell-to-cell variations in the pack (see differences at stage 2) [20].\nrange is unambiguous, as the voltage is a directly measurable quantity, unlike the\nSOC, which can underlie estimation errors and is prone to manipulation [25]. However,\nthe voltage is less accessible and currently must be reverse-engineered from controller\narea network (CAN) data so that simple access to the voltage must be granted, e.g.,\nthrough the onboard diagnosis (OBD)-II interface [26]. Nonetheless, a fixed pack-\nlevel voltage window should be used for reproducible and comparable measurements,\nwhich must be declared in the vehicle\u2019s registration documents. The voltage range\nshould hereby be as broad as necessary to capture characteristic changes in the voltage\nsignature but as narrow as possible with the cut-off voltages reachable in the typical\noperation window of an EV to ensure applicability. Some authors seek applicability by\n6\n\n--- Page 7 ---\ncorrecting a partial charging measurement with the SOC range of the measurement,\ni.e.,Q=Qpartial/\u2206SOC[27, 28]. However, a direct measurement without the estimated\nSOC is more accurate.\nAdditionally, a rest period prior to the measurement is recommended to allow\npotential gradients within the battery pack to decay exponentially, with the required\nduration depending on the excitation prior to the measurement [29]. A practical rule\nof thumb can be derived from Fernando et al. [30] that consider the voltage settled\nwhen its rate of change falls below 1 mV s\u22121\u00b7ns, where nsis the number of serially\nconnected cells, or when the variation is smaller than the voltage sensor\u2019s resolution.\nFor example, a 30-minute rest period was sufficient in this study to achieve a stable\nvoltage. Generally, the necessary resting time will increase when the battery pack is\nstressed with higher loads prior to the measurement or at lower temperatures [30].\nFurthermore, the relaxed battery pack should settle below the predefined lower voltage\nthreshold so that the defined voltage window is captured entirely.\nLastly, the behavior of LIBs is strongly influenced by the temperature, so cold or\nhot ambient conditions shall be avoided for reproducibility [31]. Hence, spatially mea-\nsured temperatures within the battery pack should lie at room temperature of 20\u25e6C in\na window of \u00b15\u25e6C before the measurement, and charging in an air-conditioned work-\nshop or garage is recommended [32]. Naturally, the battery\u2019s temperature increases\nduring the charging measurement, which can additionally be monitored to detect hot\nspots within the pack. However, excessive temperatures are typically contained by an\nEV\u2019s thermal management system, e.g., the temperatures of the specimens under test\nnever exceeded 30\u25e6C after the termination of the charging session [26].\nThe battery pack\u2019s capacity Qcalcand energy Ecalcare then calculated by time\nintegration between the lower cut-off voltage Ulowuntil the upper cut-off voltage Uhigh\nis reached by\nQcalc=ZtUhigh\ntUlowI dt (2)\nEcalc=ZtUhigh\ntUlowP dt =ZtUhigh\ntUlowU I dt \u2248Un\u00b7Qcalc.

In contrast, the capacity Qcalcplainly accounts for the charge transferred\nbetween the electrodes, independent of the voltage and the effect of overpotentials.\nTherefore, capacity provides a consistent basis for comparing changes in electrode\ncapacities to determine underlying degradation modes [33].\nFor simplicity, some authors calculate the energy Ecalcby multiplying the calcu-\nlated capacity by the nominal voltage Unof the battery pack, which must be available\nin the vehicle\u2019s registration documents, but only suits as an approximation [34].\n7\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nRegularly performing this standard measurement and referencing the measured\ncapacity and energy to the nominal values QN/ENresults in the capacity-based SOH Q\nand energy-based SOH Eby\nSOH Q=Qcalc\nQN(4)\nSOH E=Ecalc\nEN(5)\nIf available, the calculated capacity and energy can be referenced to an initial\nvalue Q0/E0reflecting an EV\u2019s individual SOH Q/E.\nBattery pack diagnostics with differential voltage analysis\nThe proposed 15-hour measurement is suited for vehicle-level DV analysis, as analyzed\nby Schmitt et al. [35], enabling deeper insights into battery degradation through the\nidentification of chemistry-specific characteristics. Nonetheless, lower charging pow-\ners are favorable with the cost of a longer measurement, as features for DV analysis\ntend to be more pronounced [36]. Thus, the measurements in this article were con-\nducted at approx. 2 kW. In DV analysis, local maxima, shown in Figure 2b for a nickel\ncobalt manganese oxide (NMC)/graphite chemistry, indicate lithiation stages of the\nLIB, which can mostly be unambiguously assigned to either the positive electrode\n(PE) or negative electrode (NE) [37]. Tracking these maxima enables the calculation\nof the electrode capacities QNE/PE and their balancing QB. These capacities change\nwith aging, from which the degradation modes loss of active material (LAM) at the\nelectrodes and loss of lithium inventory (LLI) can be determined, and aging can be\nfurther dissected [38]. Note that available characteristic features depend on the cell\nchemistry, so the degradation assessment must be tailored to the underlying battery\npack [7]. Nonetheless, the general methodology is transferable, as shown by a previous\npublication, where vehicles with different battery pack setups are compared [20]. Also,\nother aging diagnostic methods, such as incremental capacity analysis (ICA), benefit\nfrom the proposed charging procedure and can be utilized on the vehicle level [11].\nNonetheless, it is clear that battery diagnosis, e.g., through DV analysis, is not nec-\nessary for obtaining a battery pack\u2019s SOH but rather enables test facilities for a more\nprofound analysis of the battery\u2019s aging state.\nApplication of the proposed method\nThe application and universality of the proposed method is shown in Figure 3 on four\nstate-of-the-art EVs \u2013 the VW ID.3 Pro Performance, Porsche Taycan, Tesla Model 3\nStandard Range Plus, and Tesla Model Y Long Range.\nThe curves show charging measurements at an early aging state and after uti-\nlization with more mileage covered. Evaluating the energy Ecalcand capacity Qcalc\nbetween the specified voltage ranges given in Table 1 enables quantifying overall dif-\nferences in the capacity/energy. Here, the SOH metrics are calculated with the EVs\u2019\nnominal capacity and net energy, respectively, although these reference values were\n8\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nmost likely not determined by the exact proposed standard measurement. Thus, it is\nexplicitly emphasized that a reference is an essential value for SOH comparability and\nmust be available in the vehicle\u2019s registration documents with additional information\navailable on how these values are determined. Note that the Porsche Taycan and Tesla\nModel Y measurements were conducted with different vehicles of the same model type\nand battery pack specification, demonstrating comparability between specimens.\n/uni000003ef/uni000003f2/uni000003ec/uni000003ef/uni000003f5/uni000003ec/uni000003f0/uni000003ee/uni000003ec/uni000003f0/uni000003f1/uni000003ec/uni00000073/uni0000011e/uni0000015a/uni0000015d/uni00000110/uni0000016f/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni000001c0/uni0000017d/uni0000016f/uni0000019a/uni00000102/uni00000150/uni0000011e/uni00000003/uni0000015d/uni00000176/uni00000003/uni00000073\n/uni00000059/uni00000003/uni00000441/uni00000003/uni000003f2/uni00000358/uni000003ed/uni00000004/uni0000015a/uni00000003/uni0000036e/uni00000003/uni0000001c/uni00000003/uni00000441/uni00000003/uni000003ee/uni00000358/uni000003f0/uni0000016c/uni00000074/uni0000015a\n

3 : Charging measurements of different vehicle models using the proposed stan-\ndard charging measurement. a)-d) Voltage and DV curves of the VW ID.3, Porsche\nTaycan, Tesla Model 3, and Tesla Model Y. Insights from the DV curves show that\nLLI is the primary degradation mode of these battery packs.\n9\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nDeeper insights into the electrochemical aging of the battery packs are given\nthrough DV analysis, where changes in the characteristic features QPE,QNE, and QB\nare labeled. LAM at the NE is identified for the Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y.\nLAM at the PE can only be identified for the VW ID.3 and Tesla Model Y, as either\nthere is no PE feature (e.g., for Tesla Model 3\u2019s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells)\nor the feature is not unambiguously detectable (e.g., Porsche Taycan). For all vehi-\ncles, LLI, correlating with the change of the balancing feature QB, appears to be the\npredominant degradation mode at the time of the measurements and is mainly respon-\nsible for the loss of capacity/energy [39]. This aligns well with aging studies on the\ncell level under real-world conditions, where aging mechanisms binding lithium-ions,\nsuch as solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, occur early in a battery\u2019s service\nlife, directly resulting in LLI [40]. The quantitative results for the measured capac-\nities, energies, and degradation modes are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 in\nthe supplementary information.\nDiscussion\nThe proposed standard charging procedure aims to provide an unambiguous and\nreproducible measurement for determining an EV battery pack\u2019s SOH.\nThe most apparent disadvantage of the proposed standard measurement lies in its\nduration. However, the measurement time is essential to ensure an accurate calcula-\ntion of the SOH, which is highly relevant to multiple stakeholders, given the battery\npack\u2019s critical role in vehicle utilization and asset valuation. Long idle periods \u2013 such\nas overnight parking \u2013 can be leveraged to conduct the measurement with minimal\ndisruption. Moreover, the required measurement frequency remains low since battery\naging generally occurs over several years. We therefore recommend performing the\nmeasurement once or twice per year. Exceptions apply in high usage cases, where more\nfrequent measurements may be beneficial, or before the sale or purchase of a second-\nhand EV. Nevertheless, further research on the effects of higher charging powers on\nthe standard measurement is encouraged to reduce the overall testing duration.\nFurthermore, EV-specific peculiarities that influence the proposed procedure must\nbe considered, which are discussed below.\nFor instance, measuring a fleet of the same vehicle model at similar mileages, shown\nin Figure 4a for five Cupra Borns, exhibits deviations in the pack voltages. Although\ncell-to-cell variations are of small order, they can become significant in the cell assem-\nbly [41]. Furthermore, individual onboard SOC estimations refer to different voltages,\ni.e., when all Cupras were completely charged, showing 100 % SOC in the user inter-\nface (UI), the voltages differed up to 5 .4 V. Therefore, a fixed voltage window must be\ncarefully defined to fit all vehicles of a model. This, however, affects the determination\nof the EV\u2019s individual energy and capacity, as the fixed voltage ranges for the standard\nmeasurement crop the actual usable voltage window available in the vehicle. To com-\npensate for this, each vehicle would need individual cut-off voltages, thereby inhibiting\ncomparability. Differences in charging between fixed SOC and voltage boundaries, as\nwell as the repeated measurements of one specimen, are given in Table 2, showcasing\nthat fixing a voltage range is better suited for the comparability and reproducibility\nof the measurement results.\n10\n\n--- Page 11

4 : Peculiarities of EVs and their influence on the proposed standard measure-\nment. a) Measuring a fleet of identical vehicle models with comparable distance covered\nshows voltage differences so that the vehicle\u2019s individual capacity/energy content is not\nreflected with a fixed voltage window. b) Software updates can change BMS settings,\nsuch as changing the voltage operation window as shown for annual measurements\nof the exact vehicle. c) Balancing occurs when cells within the pack have imbalanced\nSOC levels. Balancing phases after reaching 100 % UI-SOC are triggered by the BMS\nto realign the cells\u2019 voltages. However, EVs in an unbalanced state can lead to incon-\nsistent cut-off voltages. The consecutive measurements were conducted on the exact\nvehicle. d) Defective cells influence the battery system, e.g., cut-off conditions are met\nprematurely, and the measured capacity/energy is reduced. Note that for these VW\nvehicles, 96 % is the maximum BMS-SOC, which equals 100 % UI-SOC.\nLikewise, interference of the BMS can hamper the standard measurement, e.g.,\nsoftware updates, possibly over-the-air, can change the voltage range of a battery\npack, altering the usable operation window and capacity/energy retention, as shown\nin Figure 4b. Therefore, changes in the battery system must transparently be commu-\nnicated to the vehicle owner so that the standard measurement and the reference for\nthe SOH can be adjusted. Moreover, balancing through the BMS takes place to align\nthe voltage levels of cells in the pack that have drifted due to (increasingly) differing\naging levels, as seen in Figure 4c. Measuring a vehicle in an unbalanced state influ-\nences the standard measurement as the upper voltage limit might not be consistent,\nand features in DV curves can fade [42]. Therefore, the cells in the pack are ideally\nbalanced prior to the measurement.\n11\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nAlso, a cell defect within the battery pack (Figure 4d) determines the usable capac-\nity/energy, as cut-off voltages are met prematurely [43]. As a result, the defined voltage\nrange may not be reachable on the pack level, and the SOH cannot be calculated with\nthe proposed standard measurement. Nonetheless, if cell-level voltage data is available,\ntargeted maintenance is possible to detect and locate faulty cells.\nRegarding degradation assessment by DV analysis on the vehicle level, the previ-\nous examples have shown that degradation modes cannot always be determined, and\nlimitations exist, e.g., BMS interference [20]. Also, it is unlikely for OEMs to publish\nvoltage-capacity curves of pristine specimens for the evaluation of degradation modes.\nHowever, test facilities can establish databases for assessing aging between EVs of the\nsame model type, as shown for the Porsche Taycan and Tesla Model Y.\nDespite the limitations discussed, we are convinced that the proposed standard\nmeasurement based on charging is useful for the SOH determination for EVs\u2019 battery\npacks, and additional information from DV analysis adds value through deeper battery\naging assessment. Thus an independent, external, and transparent battery diagnosis\nfor EVs is enabled. Further, to maximize its effectiveness, we recommend that EV\nowners perform the proposed measurement at the beginning of the vehicle\u2019s life to\nestablish a reference point for future evaluations, and enabling the possibility for\nindividual aging analysis.\nNonetheless, due to the complexity of an EV\u2019s battery pack, a capacity- and energy-\nbased SOH are merely two of many parameters necessary to fully characterize its\nmulti-dimensional SOH [44]. For instance, we also encourage a standard measurement\nfor the internal resistance ( SOH R) as it increases throughout an EV\u2019s lifetime and\ninfluences the usable SOC range, especially under high-power scenarios.\nHereby, the communications norms open charge point protocol (OCPP) 2.1 and\nISO15118-20 can be useful, enabling bidirectional charging where more sophisticated\nbattery diagnosis is possible through tailored (dis-)charging procedures, e.g., incorpo-\nrating power pulses [45]. It is assumed that future EVs will comply with these norms\nand are capable of bidirectional charging.\nFurthermore, data from vehicle sensors must be available for any onboard battery\ndiagnostic method, e.g., through the OBD interface, without encryption in sufficient\nresolution, accuracy, precision, and sample rate, at least for the voltage, current, and\nSOC on the pack level. Additional access to further information, such as module\ntemperatures and the cell voltage across each series connection, enables proactive and\ntailored maintenance, which is also encouraged. Thus, the OEMs must provide the\nrequired data, reference values, and the possibility of external battery diagnosis. For\ninstance, Tesla\u2019s \u2019battery health\u2019 implementation is a step in the right direction but\nlacks transparency about the specific measurement procedure and how the SOH is\ncalculated [46].\nUltimately, the legislator must ensure that independent battery diagnosis is\npossible, e.g., through the CEN/CENELEC standardization request M/579 aiming\nat \u201dperformance, safety and sustainability requirements for batteries\u201d, where our\nproposal can suit as a discussion basis [47].\n12\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nMethods\nThe EVs under study are presented in Section 1. Further, the measurement proce-\ndure (Section 1), vehicle data acquisition (Section 1), and postprocessing (Section 1)\nare explained in closer detail.\nVehicles under test\nThe vehicles under test are state-of-the-art EVs from VW, Cupra, Porsche and Tesla.\nThe vehicles\u2019 battery specifications are summarized in Table 1. All vehicles were\npurchased from a dealership or leased from non-OEM research partners to ensure\nunmodified mass-production specimens and an uninfluenced examination.\nSeven Volkswagen Group vehicles sharing the same battery pack with\nNMC532/graphite cells were tested: Five Cupra Borns with similar mileages (12 700-\n17 700 km) and two VW ID.3s. Both first-generation VW ID.3s were purchased in 2020.\nThe vehicle analyzed for aging was comprehensively investigated through teardown\nanalysis by Wassiliadis et al. [6]. This specimen was subject to multiple measurements\nbetween mileages of 400 km and 40 500 km at different software releases and balancing\nstates and was previously analyzed by DV analysis at lower mileages [20]. The second\nVW ID.3 has a defective cell limiting the overall battery pack performance.\nThe 2020 Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus is equipped with prismatic\nLFP/graphite cells that have been comprehensively investigated at the cell level [48]\nand vehicle level [26]. The vehicle was measured at mileages 1000 km and 80 100 km\nand was previously analyzed by DV analysis at lower mileages [20].\nTwo 2022 Porsche Taycans from different sources were measured at mileages\nof 10 000 km and 70 500 km. Both vehicles share the same battery pack with\nNMC622/graphite cells. Also two Tesla Model Y Long Range vehicles (manufac-\ntured in 2022 and 2024) with mileages of 77 600 km and 24 800 km were measured.\nAnk et al. [49] investigated the NMC 811/graphite chemistry used by both vehi-\ncles. These measurements show that aging assessment through the proposed standard\nmeasurement is comparable within vehicle models.\nMeasurement procedure\nA battery cell\u2019s remaining capacity/energy is typically determined during reoc-\ncurring check-ups from controlled (dis-)charging cycles between fixed boundary\nconstraints [50]. This general procedure is transferred onto the vehicle level through a\ncontrolled charging cycle adapted to the vehicles\u2019 usage window, similar to Wassiliadis\net al. [6]. Note that the SOC displayed in the UI differs from the BMS-SOC, possibly\nto preserve energy buffers. Here, only the BMS-SOC is considered.\nThe vehicles are fully discharged to 0 % SOC before the measurement, whereby the\nlast few percent are drained using auxiliary units. After the discharging procedure, the\nvehicles were set to rest for approx. 30 min for further overpotentials to settle before\nthe charging session is triggered by connecting the vehicle to the AC (IEC 61851 mode)\ncharging device Juice Booster 2 (Juice Technology, Switzerland). The charging device\ncan supply charging powers between 1 .4 kW and 22 kW depending on the connected\nsocket (single/triple phase). A quasi-stationary measurement is sought by preferring\n13\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nlow charging powers to reduce the effects of overpotentials and inhomogeneity in the\nNE [51]. Therefore, the charging power is set to yield at least a 30 h charging session\ncalculated by the vehicles\u2019 net energy content. Other authors found that a 15 h charging\nsession is sufficient and does not mitigate the SOH calculation or aging assessment [35].\nThe vehicles are exclusively charged inside a workshop at an ambient temperature of\n20\u25e6C until the BMS terminates the charging session. The capacity and energy are\ncalculated between fixed voltage ranges, given in Table 1 defined for each EV model.\nData acquisition\nThe measurement procedure relies on onboard sensor data of the vehicles under test,\nwhich is recorded using different methods depending on the manufacturer. The most\nrelevant high voltage (HV) battery pack level signals are the voltage, current, and\nBMS/UI-SOC. The cell voltages across each serial connection and temperature data\nare also sampled when available. The data is recorded with the precision of the built-in\nsensors that have sufficient data quality for further processing [20].\nThe entire CAN bus communication is recorded for the Tesla vehicles via a CAN\ninterface with the recording tool Busmaster. The data is converted into physical and\nhuman-readable quantities by a publicly available .dbc file from GitHub. The correct-\nness of the conversion schemes is asserted by comparison to data from a commercially\navailable vehicle diagnostic device, which is unsuitable for logging over a long period.\nThe sample rate is 100 Hz for the pack current, voltage, and SOC and 0 .5 Hz for the\ncell voltages. The resolution of the digitized signals can be estimated from the sampled\ndata as 0 .1 V for the voltages, 0 .1 A for the current, and 0 .1 % for the SOC.\nData from the VW group vehicles is queried by unified diagnostic services (UDS)\nsent through the OBD-II diagnostic interface and converted with a custom UDS\ndecoder tool. Each request addresses a unique identifier (ID) reverse-engineered by\nreproducing the traffic from a commercially available vehicle diagnostic device. An\nin-depth description of the data acquisition is given by Merkle et al. [52]. During\nthe measurement, the individual values are requested at 1 Hz. However, the gateway\nboard, responsible for handling requests, responds to requests depending on the avail-\nable bandwidth. In practice, a sample is logged in a frequency between 0 .1 Hz and\n1 Hz. The resolution of the digitized signals can be estimated from the sampled data\nas 0.25 V for the voltages, 0 .1 A for the current, and 0 .40 % for the SOC.\nData postprocessing\nThe long-format data traces are subsequently synchronized onto a single time vector\nby linear interpolation and cropped to fit the voltage range specified in Table 1. The\ndata is filtered by a mean filter in the forward direction with a window size of 1 %\nof data points to generalize between different vector lengths. The capacity Qcalcand\nEcalcare calculated by Equation 2 and Equation 3, respectively.\n14\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nThe DV curve is calculated from the derivatives of the pack voltage and capacity\nsignals by\nDV=dU/dt\ndQ/dt\u2248\u2206U\n\u2206Q. (6)\nFor practical applications, the DV curve is calculated by forward difference\nschemes [53]. Furthermore, the DV curve is normalized by the nominal capacity QN\ngiven in Table 1, through which the data is scaled in y-direction around the number\nof series-connected cells in the battery pack, enhancing the comparability between\nbattery systems with different capacities. Care must be taken when applying filtering\nmethods, as these can alter features of interest [54].\nDeclarations\nData availability.
